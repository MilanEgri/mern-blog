<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow this guide to run the application.

### Prerequisites

- Have NodeJS installed on your system. You can get NodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

- Create a free database at MongoDB Atlas:
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register and register an account.
2. After logging in click the `Database` item from the left sidebar and then click `Build database`.
3. You will see multiple price plans, select the free one.
4. Select a provider, select the region that is the closest to you, name your database and click on `Create`.
5. On the next page you will need to create an user for the database. Select `Username and Password`, choose an username and a password and click `Create User`.
6. At the bottom of this page click `Add My Current IP Address`.
7. Click `Finish and Close`
8. You will be redirected to the Overview page, if you did everything correctly, the database you created should show up here.
9. Click on `Connect` and then `Compass`. You don't need to download anything, only the connection string is needed from here.
10. Copy the connection string and replace the `<password>` part with the password you previously created for this database. You will need this string in the Installation part of this guide.

### Installation

1. Open the terminal.
2. Clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:MilanEgri/mern-blog.git
    ```
3. Navigate into the `client` folder:
   ```sh
   cd mern-blog/client/
   ```
4. Install the NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
5. Navigate into the `server` folder:
   ```sh
   cd ../server/
   ```
6. Install the NPM packages for this folder too
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
7. Open a text editor and write the following into a new text file:
   ```sh
   MONGO_URL=<your connection string>
   ```
   Replace the `<your connection string>` part with the connection string you copied in the Prerequisites section.
   Save this file in the `/server` directory as `.env` (don't write any name just the .env extension)
    
### Usage

1. Open two separate terminals and navigate to the project directory.
2. Navigate to the `server` folder and run this command:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
   The ExpressJS server will start, leave this running during the usage.
3. Navigate to the `client` folder in the other terminal and run this command:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The React development server will start, leave this running during the usage.
